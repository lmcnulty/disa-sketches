<p>
I was told that we don't want to have owners as persons in the database. 
I was wondering whether it might be preferable to include them in the  
database but hide them from the public-facing interface. 
</p>
<p>
It seems plausible that someone might want to look at all the slaves 
owned by the same person. If we just enter owners as a name attached to 
each slave, then we're likely to have problems if we have different owners 
with the same name. Also, searching for matching strings is probably going 
to be slower than searching for matching IDs. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, we could encounter instances where an owner was also a 
family member, or maybe even cases where a slave was freed and then became 
an owner.
</p>
<p>
In order to handle these problems, I suspect that we're either going to 
need to include owners as persons, or we're going to need a separate type 
of entry for owners which would end up being used a lot like a person 
entry anyway, as it would have at least some of the same fields "eg: name" 
and it would be capable of having relations with persons.

<h3>Issues in Revising</h3>

Some of the requested changes that I'm not sure how to handle.

<ul>

<li>
<b>Death date</b><br>
	Based on the current schema, I think this would be represented by the date of the record of death. 
</li>
<li>
<b>Shipping and sales information</b><br>
	This is not in the schema.
</li>
<li>
<b>Location: Town</b> <br>
	This would be easy to add, but is not in the schema: the `Location` table only has fields for Nation, State, and Colony.
</li>
<li>
<b>Multiple names and name types</b><br>
	Would this be for one document referring to someone by multiple names, or two different documents giving different names? In the former case, it seems like the `Actor` table would need to be expanded to hold more than one name. In the latter case, it goes to the higher level question of how we know that two documents reference the same individual, which I was told we weren't considering yet.
</li>
<li>
<b>Add a document</b><br>
	Again, I thought we weren't considering having multiple documents for a single individual. If this is meant to add a document independent of an individual, I would expect that it would be a completely separate form.
</li>
</ul>
