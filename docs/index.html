<h1>Disa Sketches</h1>

<h3>Issues in Revising</h3>

Some of the requested changes that I'm not sure how to handle.

<ul>

<li>
<b>Death date</b><br>
	Based on the current schema, I think this would be represented by the date of the record of death. 
</li>
<li>
<b>Shipping and sales information</b><br>
	This is not in the schema.
</li>
<li>
<b>Location: Town</b> <br>
	This would be easy to add, but is not in the schema: the `Location` table only has fields for Nation, State, and Colony.
</li>
<li>
<b>Multiple names and name types</b><br>
	Would this be for one document referring to someone by multiple names, or two different documents giving different names? In the former case, it seems like the `Actor` table would need to be expanded to hold more than one name. In the latter case, it goes to the higher level question of how we know that two documents reference the same individual, which I was told we weren't considering yet.
</li>
<li>
<b>Add a document</b><br>
	Again, I thought we weren't considering having multiple documents for a single individual. If this is meant to add a document independent of an individual, I would expect that it would be a completely separate form.
</li>
</ul>
