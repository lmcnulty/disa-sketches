			Welcome to the Database of Indigenous Slavery in the Americas (DISA). This project, housed at Brown University, is a collaborative effort to build a database of enslaved indigenous people throughout time all across the Americas. Please note that this site is under construction, and the database does not yet have a public portal. We are actively working on this project, however, and and are looking for volunteers and scholars to contribute materials. We invite you to scroll down or visit our About page to learn more about the project and how to contribute.

				<h3 class="entry-title">About</h3>
				<p><strong>The concept:</strong></p>
				<p>The Database of Indigenous Slavery in the Americas (DISA), is a database that seeks to document as many instances of indigenous enslavement in the Americas between 1492 and 1900 (and beyond, where relevant).<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The hemispheric study of Native American slavery represents cutting-edge research in multi-lingual and multi-national contexts in the Americas. Scholars now estimate that between 2.5 and 5 million Natives were enslaved in the Americas between 1492 and the late nineteenth century – an astonishing number by any measure (even compared to the approximately 12 million Africans who were brought as slaves from Africa in this same time period). DISA will allow the slow centralization of biographical information related to enslaved indigenous people and place them online where historians, researchers, students, tribal members, and families can use the information to reconstruct histories, chart networks, and make connections in ways that have never before been possible.</p>
				<p><strong>Timeline:</strong></p>
				<p>We are currently applying for larger grants and hope to have a public-facing prototype in the summer of 2018.</p>
				<p><strong>How to contribute:</strong></p>
				<p>In this early phase, the database is not yet public. While we are working on funding, a small team of researchers is slowly adding to the database. We are looking to partner with individuals and institutions who are willing to send materials they have or join our research team to input materials directly. Please contact <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/lf7">Linford D. Fisher</a> to learn more.</p>

				<h3>Latest Blog Entry</h3>
				<h4>DISA: a brief introduction and update </h4>
				<p>Greetings, and thanks for visiting this site. The idea for a database that centralizes all known biographical information about known instances of indigenous slavery in the Americas has been percolating for some time. In 2015 I began to slowly apply for small amounts of funding internally here at Brown to take the first steps towards amassing data and building a website. I’m grateful that the Center for Digital Scholarship here at Brown has been willing to generously help out in terms of computer programming and tech support... [<a href="">Continue</a>]</p>

			<p>In this early phase, the database is not yet public. While we are working on funding, a small team of researchers is slowly adding to the database. You can contribute to this project by sending us any and all listings or spreadsheets of indigenous slaves that you have compiled in your own research. Please email them to: linford_fisher@brown.edu</p>
